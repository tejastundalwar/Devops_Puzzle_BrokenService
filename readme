🧩 Fix The Pipeline — DevOps Puzzle

Break it. Debug it. Deploy it.
A fun, interactive DevOps puzzle where you act like a real SRE: find the issue, trigger CI/CD, and bring the service back online.

🚀 What is This?

Fix The Pipeline is a mini DevOps game + demo project:

A service is intentionally broken

You click Check Logs to see why

You click Fix & Redeploy

A real GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline runs

After deployment, the service becomes LIVE

Built to show real-world DevOps flow in a fun, recruiter-friendly way.
